            <p> Hi, my name is Sophia Deng and my pronouns are she/her. I love staying home to relax and to play
            games with my friends. The types of games I pay is a mixture of FPS and farming simulation games, like,
            Overwatch, Valorant, Minecraft, and Stardew Valley. A hobby I picked up over the pandemic was crocheting and
            that's something I really enjoy doing. I love the different patterns I could make and practice to perfect my
            craft, which is what I'm currently trrying to do with graphic design. I have always loved doing anything art
            related, which is why I chose graphic design as my future career. I want to be able to learn more skills so that
            I'm able to create work that'll inspire not only other people, but also myself. I think the biggest challenge for me
            is going to be coding just becuase I'm not the best with technology, but overall, I'm excited to learn new skills and
            hone them. Fun fact about me is that I could eat fruits and chips any day and any time.
            </p>
