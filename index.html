                        <p> Hi, my name is Sophia Deng and my pronouns are she/her. I love staying home to relax and to play
                            games with my friends. The types of games I pay is a mixture of FPS and farming simulation games, like,
                            Overwatch, Valorant, Minecraft, and Stardew Valley. A hobby I picked up over the pandemic was crocheting and
                            that's something I really enjoy doing. I love the different patterns I could make and practice to perfect my
                            craft, which is what I'm currently trrying to do with graphic design. I have always loved doing anything art
                            related, which is why I chose graphic design as my future career. I want to be able to learn more skills so that
                            I'm able to create work that'll inspire not only other people, but also myself. I think the biggest challenge for me
                            is going to be coding just becuase I'm not the best with technology, but overall, I'm excited to learn new skills and
                            hone them. Fun fact about me is that I could eat fruits and chips any day and any time. Maybe chips a little more than 
                            fruits. When I got Covid during the pandemic, my throat was so sore that I could barely eat anything solid, which also
                            meant chips. It was so hard to resist that I had to nipple on a couple pieces. This is me, a chip loving aspiring graphic
                            designer.
