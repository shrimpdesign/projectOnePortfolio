            <p>David's work is versitile. I love the pop of neon green he used for his website and how he showcases his skills.
            There are so many different fonts and sizes for each project he worked for, and that encourages me to explore all
            he different styles.

            <p>boringfriend's art work inpires me because I love the playful phrases they come up with to match the artwork that's
            created and their use of color. This inspires me to create work that would reach someone who can relate to my work
            and also feel inspired by what I created.

            <img class="abra" src="img/madeByAbraBridge.png" alt="four kids playing together on a bridge">

            <p>madebyabra is one of my favorite artists because I love the style of their work and the way they choose their
            color palattes for each piece. I'm usually drawn to cute and colorful things and they're doing exactly that. Their
            style also reminds me of nintendo games, which is another reason why I'm inspired by their work because I grew up playing
            nintendo games and their style also feels nostalgic to me.
